The concept of integrating blockchain technology into voting systems represents a paradigm shift in ensuring transparent, secure and accessible elections. Our goal is to implement a decentralized and secure framework that can potentially address these challenges by using one of most innovative and cutting edge technology: blockchain. 


Database creation:
